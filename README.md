In this project I have used HTML, CSS, JAVASCRIPT
- HTML is used to display the text using some tag like(<p> witch is used to give you a sentenca in paragraph , <h> it is used for headings it will get vary in size <h1><h2><h3><h4><h5><h6> its used for heading size . In this we will give some class name or id
to call the function in css
- CSS is used to design a weboage or website using style , font-size,font-color,back ground image, background color, some tag is used to stop the repeated image.href is used to link the saprate code to css
it  is used to save the data in server using mangodb, so the data will be stored in the server but in this project I didn't use, so the data will not be stored in the data base
